# Getting Started

Goal: go from zero to a first working chat with minimal setup.

Fastest chat: open the Control UI (no channel setup needed). Run \`openclaw dashboard\` and chat in the browser, or open \`http://127.0.0.1:18789/\` on the gateway host. Docs: \[Dashboard]\(/web/dashboard) and \[Control UI]\(/web/control-ui).

## Prereqs

* Node 22 or newer

Check your Node version with \`node --version\` if you are unsure.

## Quick setup (CLI)

\`\`\`bash curl -fsSL https://openclaw.ai/install.sh | bash \`\`\`  \`\`\`powershell iwr -useb https://openclaw.ai/install.ps1 | iex \`\`\`

```
<Note>
Other install methods and requirements: [Install](/install).
</Note>
```

\`\`\`bash openclaw onboard --install-daemon \`\`\`

```
The wizard configures auth, gateway settings, and optional channels.
See [Onboarding Wizard](/start/wizard) for details.
```

If you installed the service, it should already be running:

````
```bash
openclaw gateway status
```
````

\`\`\`bash openclaw dashboard \`\`\` If the Control UI loads, your Gateway is ready for use.

## Optional checks and extras

Useful for quick tests or troubleshooting.

````
```bash
openclaw gateway --port 18789
```
````

Requires a configured channel.

````
```bash
openclaw message send --target +15555550123 --message "Hello from OpenClaw"
```
````

## Useful environment variables

If you run OpenClaw as a service account or want custom config/state locations:

* `OPENCLAW_HOME` sets the home directory used for internal path resolution.
* `OPENCLAW_STATE_DIR` overrides the state directory.
* `OPENCLAW_CONFIG_PATH` overrides the config file path.

Full environment variable reference: [Environment vars](../../help/environment/).

## Go deeper

Full CLI wizard reference and advanced options. First run flow for the macOS app.

## What you will have

* A running Gateway
* Auth configured
* Control UI access or a connected channel

## Next steps

* DM safety and approvals: [Pairing](../../channels/pairing/)
* Connect more channels: [Channels](../../channels/)
* Advanced workflows and from source: [Setup](../../start/setup/)
