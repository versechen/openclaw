# Onboarding (macOS App)

This doc describes the **current** first‑run onboarding flow. The goal is a smooth “day 0” experience: pick where the Gateway runs, connect auth, run the wizard, and let the agent bootstrap itself. For a general overview of onboarding paths, see [Onboarding Overview](../../start/onboarding-overview/).

&#x20;&#x20;

Security trust model:

* By default, OpenClaw is a personal agent: one trusted operator boundary.
* Shared/multi-user setups require lock-down (split trust boundaries, keep tool access minimal, and follow [Security](../../gateway/security/)).



Where does the **Gateway** run?

* **This Mac (Local only):** onboarding can configure auth and write credentials locally.
* **Remote (over SSH/Tailnet):** onboarding does **not** configure local auth; credentials must exist on the gateway host.
* **Configure later:** skip setup and leave the app unconfigured.

\*\*Gateway auth tip:\*\*

* The wizard now generates a **token** even for loopback, so local WS clients must authenticate.
* If you disable auth, any local process can connect; use that only on fully trusted machines.
* Use a **token** for multi‑machine access or non‑loopback binds.



Onboarding requests TCC permissions needed for:

* Automation (AppleScript)
* Notifications
* Accessibility
* Screen Recording
* Microphone
* Speech Recognition
* Camera
* Location

This step is optional The app can install the global \`openclaw\` CLI via npm/pnpm so terminal workflows and launchd tasks work out of the box. After setup, the app opens a dedicated onboarding chat session so the agent can introduce itself and guide next steps. This keeps first‑run guidance separate from your normal conversation. See \[Bootstrapping]\(/start/bootstrapping) for what happens on the gateway host during the first agent run.
